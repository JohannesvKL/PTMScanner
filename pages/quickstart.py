This app serves both as documentation and showcase what's possible with OpenMS web apps. 
            
In general there are two options for building workflows.
            
#### 1. üöÄ **TOPP Workflow Framework**
            
Use this option if you want a standardized framework for building your workflow.

- **pre-defined user interface** all in one streamlit page with all steps in different tabs:
    - **File Upload**: upload, download and delete input files
    - **Configure**: Automatically display input widgets for all paramters in TOPP tools and custom Python scripts
    - **Run**: Start and stop workflow execution, includes continous log
    - **Results**: Interactive result dashboard
- **write less code**: everything from file upload, input widget generation and execution of tools is handled via convenient functions
- **fast and performant workflows**: Automatic parallel execution of TOPP tools ensures great speed, comparable with workflows written in bash
